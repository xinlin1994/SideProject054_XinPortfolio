			<p style="text-indent:50px;">
				My name is Xin Lin, a fourth-year Early Childhood Studies
				student from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson).
				As a registered early childhood educator with a two-year valid
				Early Childhood Studies diploma from George Brown College, I
				have four years of working experience with children aged from
				infancy to kindergartner in Toronto licensed childcare centers.
				Besides, I am fluent in both English and Mandarin. I used to
				work as a bilingual teacher in Chinaâ€™s international school with
				children from age four to six last year.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent:50px;">
				I have experience not only in curriculum planning and teaching,
				but also in helping students from culturally diverse backgrounds
				and children with various special needs. I have knowledge in
				both played-based program planning and program-based learning
				curriculum design. I am familiar with relevant Ontario
				educational documents such as How Does Learning Happened, The
				Kindergarten Program, and The Ontario Curriculum Grades 1-8. In
				addition, I have experience in cooperating with a different
				resource centre to address parents' parenting concerns and
				assist children's learning development based on their individual
				needs.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent:50px;">
				Because becoming a great educator is my biggest goal, I have
				decided to continue my education degree at Ryerson University in
				the fall of 2021. As an educator, I feel that parenting is the
				most critical factor in a child's development, so I value the
				home-school relationship. I like to create a program to address
				the needs of each child and share information to support parents
				in improving their parenting skills. As a current
				student-teacher, I also hope to have the opportunity to connect
				with parents and use what I have learned to help different
				families and learn how to be a better educator.

				Diverse children's literature is commonly regarded as writings
				that explore themes about ethnicity,
				race, culture, and language. Using diverse children's literature
				can support groups that have been
				exposed to systemic bias, because those books not only recognize
				different national’s identities, but
				also assist different groups of children in making a smooth
				transition from their home to school.

				I have shared eight children’s books for the Indigenous family
				in this assignment. The Indigenous people
				face many inequalities in this society, and health inequality is
				the majority of the inequality they
				suffer from. This assignment aims to support the health
				development of Indigenous children by using a
				variety of Indigenous children’s books.

				One of ECE's job responsibilities is to provide different
				resources based on the needs of each family.
				The ECE needs to have the ability to search for resources in
				order to provide better support to
				families. Through this assignment, I have learned how to find
				different programs to improve the
				parenting skills of families.

				Many immigrant families live in poverty and face challenges in
				childcare, and their diverse life
				experiences can be a barrier for them to achieve their high
				expectations of their children's education.
				The Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters program
				can support new immigrant mothers to
				work as the first teacher in helping children to get ready for
				school at the preschool age.

				Language is an essential skill that a child can develop at home
				and school in a language-rich
				environment. Having a variety of language programs available at
				the start of the school year can assist
				students and their families make a smooth transition from
				kindergarten to Grade 1. I have learned how to
				plan diverse home school programs to support children’s literacy
				development.
